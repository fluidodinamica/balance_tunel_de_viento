# Operation of the wind tunnel
### The wind tunnel work with two electric generators pluged by series, to switch on the wind tunnel you have to switch on the generators and fix a voltage. The speed of the air inside of the wind tunnel is then unknow. The speed inside the wind tunnel being linearly compared to the voltage, so we can find it using the linearity coefficient.  
### We take the followed measures of the speed for different voltage by using the  measure device testo 405i:

### From this measures, we make the chart of the speed inside of the wind tunnel compared to the voltage, and we get the linearity coefficient:

### So, we have the linearity coefficient: k=0,0915 m/s/V. From this coefficient, we can fix any speed inside the wind tunnel while that not exceed 5m/s witch is the maximal speed with this generators.
